    "### 📘 Intro Draft (Revised)\n",
    "“This is the first tutorial in a series on cyclic error-correcting codes.\n",
    "We’ll start by laying down the foundation — Galois Field arithmetic — since it's at the heart of how these codes work.”\n",
    "\n",
    "“Now, you might have come across this from a digital communications background, or maybe you’re working in embedded systems or coding theory, or just trying to understand how error correction works under the hood.\n",
    "Wherever you're coming from, you're in the right place.”\n",
    "\n",
    "“There are a lot of good resources out there — but when I was learning this, I struggled to find one that explained everything clearly, from first principles, with reasoning — not just rules or abstract math.\n",
    "So I decided to build the kind of tutorial I wish I had when I started.”\n",
    "\n",
    "“My goal is simple: if you’re using this series as your go-to reference, it should be as smooth as possible to understand what cyclic codes are, how they work, and how to implement them — in software, and maybe in hardware later on.”\n",
    "\n",
    "“Alright. Let’s get started.\n",
    "What exactly are cyclic codes?\n",
    "Where do they fit in the world of error correction?\n",
    "And what makes them so widely used?”\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🎙️ Voiceover Script: Intro to Cyclic Codes\n",
    "“Before diving deeper into Galois Fields, let’s take a quick step back — and set the stage with a short review of cyclic codes.”\n",
    "\n",
    "“Two of the most prominent families are Reed–Solomon and BCH codes. These were introduced in the early 1960s and have been used in everything from deep space communications to CDs, DVDs, storage drives, satellite links, QR codes, and more.”\n",
    "\n",
    "“In a field that changes constantly — where algorithms and standards evolve every few years — it’s rare to find a technique that holds its ground for over six decades.”\n",
    "\n",
    "“So what makes cyclic codes so powerful, and so durable?”\n",
    "\n",
    "“A big part of the answer lies in this: they represent messages as polynomials.”\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🤝 Bridge: Cyclic Codes → Polynomials\n",
    "“Instead of thinking about data as strings of bits or numbers, cyclic codes treat data as coefficients of a polynomial.”\n",
    "“This isn’t just a clever encoding trick — it gives us structure. A way to apply algebra directly to the message.”\n",
    "\n",
    "“We can shift, combine, and divide these polynomials. We can analyze their roots. And we can detect and correct errors through the lens of algebra, not brute-force logic.”\n",
    "\n",
    "“In short, polynomials give us a framework where errors show up with patterns — and that lets us find and fix them efficiently.”\n",
    "\n",
    "“But — there’s a catch. This only works if the arithmetic behind those polynomials behaves predictably. And that’s why we need Galois Fields.”"
